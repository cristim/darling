/*
 * Guest-side WKWebView, backed by a host engine.
 *
 * Drop-in replacement for the 32-line stub currently at
 * src/frameworks/WebKit/src/WKWebView.m, whose catch-all
 * methodSignatureForSelector: returns "v@:" for every selector and whose
 * forwardInvocation: only logs. That is not merely unimplemented: the wrong
 * signature means initWithFrame:configuration: returns void-garbage, and the
 * caller traps on it. YouLearn v0.3.1 died exactly there
 * (SIGTRAP, exit 133) before any WebKit behaviour was even reached.
 *
 * The real engine runs on the Linux host, in darling-webkit-host, which speaks
 * the protocol in dwb_client.h. This file owns no engine logic; it owns AppKit
 * state and maps the public WKWebView surface onto the transport.
 *
 * CAVEAT, stated plainly: this file has not been compiled, because building it
 * needs a macOS toolchain and the Darling build tree, neither of which was
 * available to the session that wrote it. Everything it delegates to - framing,
 * the shared-memory path, sequence tracking, error events, resize, failed
 * navigation - is implemented and tested off-target in dwb_client.c against a
 * live host, 18/18 on both backends. What is unverified here is only the ObjC
 * glue: selectors this implementation does not cover still fall through to the
 * stub behaviour inherited from WebKit.m, which is the pre-existing behaviour
 * and no worse.
